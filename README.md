# R1 Chain-of-Thought Analyzer

A project to analyze the thought patterns of DeepSeek-R1 8B

The data are some pre-annotated versions of R1's chain-of-thought.
The thoughts were generated in response to MATH500 questions.

Notably, the thoughts were generated using the 8 billion parameter R1, so they have some weird misspellings and odd artifacts.

Also, the annotation was generated by Claude Sonnet 3.7, but on manual inspection they aren't the best.

Still, I think it's interesting to decompose what's happening in the chain-of-thought.

The specific behavioral patterns used were sourced from [this](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OwhVWNOBcz&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Philip%20Torr%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Philip_Torr1)) research paper from DeepMind.

The figures generated from running the main module are available in the images directory.
